##BaseRichBolt

You must – and are able to – manually ack() an incoming tuple.

Can be used to delay acking a tuple,

e.g. for algorithms that need to work across multiple incoming tuples.
##BaseBasicBolt

Auto-acks the incoming tuple at the end of its execute() method.

These bolts are typically simple functions or filters.
